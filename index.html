        <h2>Welcome to Learning Web Development</h2>
            <p>Learning how to program and develop websites is an interesting skill to develop in our technology-driven world. While it might be intimidating at first, learning how to code is a very rewarding experience. With hard work, motivation and perseverance, anyone can learn the skills needed to develop beautiful and usable websites. The new set of skills that you learn along the way might take you on a new journey in the web development world. Learning how to code is a first step on this path.</p>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, your first steps in learning web development might be difficult and intimidating. This is okay: learning is a lifelong journey. With the amount of information online, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by the vast quantity of resources and anyone can face a choice overload: not being able to make a decision when faced with too many options. While this is a reality, we should not feel discouraged by it. The amount of resources is actually something we should be thankful for. Different resources might fit different learners' styles and everyone should be able to find educational tools that fit their way of learning. We are so far from the times when you just add a few paid resources available to learn new skills. Let's embrace this.</p>
            <p>This website is there to help you find educational resources in web development. It's an overview of some of the best resources to start on your self-teaching adventure. We'll present some of the best books on the topic as well as a lot of free web resources and a few paying classes.</p>

        <h2>Before you start</h2>
            <p>Before you start on your learning journey, let's have a quick talk about your front-end web development set-up.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>An operating system: it could be MacOS, Windows or Linux. You should pick the OS you are comfortable with.</li>
                <li>A browser: being able to see how your site looks on different browsers is a must in web development. Having Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Edge and Opera installed might help you see yours sites in different browsers. You should also use cross browser testing tools to test compatibility with older browsers.</li>
                <li>A text editor. There are so many options out there, my favorites are: <a href="http://brackets.io/" target="_blank">Brackets</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">SublimeText</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VisualStudioCode</a>.  Download them, play around and see which one you prefer using.</li>
                <li>Another great resource for beginner is <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>: an easy to use web development environment to build, test, and discover front-end code. It helps developers to better understand how the website is built and how code works.</li>
