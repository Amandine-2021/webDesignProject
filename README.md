# webDesignProject
This project is a website about web development that I did for a web design class.  
The basic requirements for the project were to design a 6 page website displaying different skills we learned in class, 
making sure the html and css pass the W3C validation and having a well organized external CSS file.  
I decided to make a website about web development to keep an organized website that references to some of the concepts I learned in class 
and to add other references useful in web development.  
For this site, I used HTML and CSS.
